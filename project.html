      </div>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <img src="coding.jpg" />
      <p>
        This web development journey has been anything but easy. It started
        years ago, marked by unfinished tasks and a battle with procrastination.
        The early days were filled with excitement, but that quickly gave way to
        frustration as I struggled to stay consistent. Projects would begin with
        enthusiasm, only to be abandoned halfway through when doubts or
        distractions crept in. Procrastination wasn’t just a habit; it felt like
        a constant companion, whispering excuses and delaying progress.
        Deadlines became flexible, goals felt distant, and progress was slow.
        Despite all this, there was always a spark—a reminder of why I started
        in the first place. That spark kept me coming back, even when it felt
        like I was starting from scratch over and over again.

      <h2>FreeCodeCamp</h2>

      <p>
        Thankfully, FreeCodeCamp became a game-changer, offering an incredible
        learning platform to keep me on track. Its structured lessons and
        hands-on projects gave me the guidance I desperately needed. I set a
        personal goal to earn at least 200 points daily, transforming my
        sporadic learning into a consistent habit. Some days were tougher than
        others, with challenges that stretched my understanding and patience,
        but I stayed committed. That commitment paid off when I completed the
        first course just before the deadline. It was a small victory, but it
        felt monumental—a reminder that discipline and focus could overcome the
        procrastination that once held me back. FreeCodeCamp wasn’t just a
        resource; it became a foundation, helping me rebuild confidence in my
        ability to learn and grow.

      <h2>Struggles and Achievements</h2>
      <img src="pain.jpg" />
      <p>
        At first glance, HTML seemed straightforward, a language of tags and
        structure that appeared easy to master. However, as I progressed, I
        realized how many gaps existed in my understanding. Simple concepts I
        thought I had mastered suddenly seemed more complex when applied in
        real-world scenarios. I had no choice but to go back to the basics and
        revisit every step, breaking down even the simplest elements. While it
        felt repetitive at times, it became a much-needed revision, reinforcing
        what I knew and clarifying what I didn’t. Each completed section brought
        a new wave of understanding, and the process turned out to be both
        enlightening and deeply satisfying. By the end, I didn’t just know
        HTML—I understood it, and that foundation became a cornerstone for
        everything I would learn moving forward.

      <h2>Hosting Our Work</h2>

      <p>
        Our lecturer later assigned us to host one of our FreeCodeCamp projects
        on a free hosting platform. Unfortunately, I was caught up with other
        responsibilities when the instruction came in on Saturday. Luckily, I
        had the project ready and delegated the hosting task to one of my team
        members. They handled it flawlessly, showcasing the amazing teamwork we
        have in our group, Byte Savants.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        This journey has been challenging but rewarding, and the support from my
        team has been a cornerstone of my progress.
